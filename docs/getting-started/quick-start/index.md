### 2. Create Docker Compose manifest

Create `docker-compose.yml` file. Paste the content presented below and save the file on your hard drive.

``` yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: "3.9"

services:
  ice:
    image: <image-you-will-receive-after-joining-reviewers-group>
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - websight_repository:/websight/repository
      - websight_html:/websight/docroot
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - websight_html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro

volumes:
  websight_repository:
  websight_html:
```

### 3. Run the local instance

Open the terminal next to the `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command:

```
docker compose up
```

The fresh WebSight instance will start in a couple of seconds. Now, you may enter [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to open the WebSight admin panel.
Log in with `admin` username and `admin` as a password.

!!! info "Tip"
  
    To stop the environment use `ctrl + c`. You may run it later exactly the same as it was started for the first time.
