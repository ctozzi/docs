# Styling

You can use any approach that suits you to include your CSS files. The easiest way is to add a link to an online library or .css file in:

```
ui.apps/src/main/jcr_root/apps/howlite/components/page/head-libs.html
```

Sample CSS file inclusion is presented below.

``` html title="ui.apps/src/main/jcr_root/apps/howlite/components/page/head-libs.html" 

<link href="/apps/howlite/web_root/theme.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

```
